So first I implemented a hamburger menu for when the screen is at a smaller size. Implementing this hamburger menu I added html, css, and js. For html I had to create a div tag to store the pseudo-classes that I were gonna use. 
In addition, I had to add html for the new bar that slides in when the hamburger icon is clicked. In css I used pseudo-classes to animate the hamburger icon and styled the icon itself. 
I also styled the new mobile navigation bar making it look nice. Finally I added js to toggle the hamburger icon on and off. So when the icon is pressed the dropdow menu pulls in from the side. 
Next I added blur effect for when the dropdown is open or active. I first added a div tag to my html. Then I used css to style the div tag so it only covers the background and not the dropdown menu. Finally I used js to 
toggle the blur effect. The blur effect shows when the hamburger icon is pressed.

I included the google analytics 3rd party script because I thought it would be useful for me to understand how attractive my website is. Google analytics shows me the percentage of people visiting that only visit one page. 
If I know that this percentage is low that means my website isn't optimized or attractive. In addition, google analytics helps shows me the demographic of my audience. This helps me change my website accordingly to fit
the age group that visits my website more. Finally, google analytics shows me what type of device users visit the website on. This data let me know which media query has to be extra attractive and extra responsive.
